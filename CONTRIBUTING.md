#Contributing to `nodeo` HowTo

The best way to do it is to create a pull request by forking,
modifying and requesting a pull using the `hub` GitHub command line
tool or directly from the web. 

I'm not too picky about features and stuff. If it fixes an error, I
would be grateful if you first created an issue indicating the bug
you're about to fix. If it's a new feature, I'll gladly accept
it. This is not in a stage where I can, like, reject new features. But
as you might have seen, features are all tested so no new feature
accepted without the corresponding test. Test it in advance using `npm
test` or let Travis do the work for you. Obviously, no new feature
will be accepted if it does not pass the test. 

Anything not covered here? Raise an issue and I'll comply.

##Where to start

If you're looking for something to contribute, any fitness function
will be fine, we're always short of fitness functions to test. Check
[Ackley](/lib/Nodeo/Ackley.js) for an example.
