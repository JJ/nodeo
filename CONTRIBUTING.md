#Contributing to `nodEO`: HowTo

The best way to do it is to create a pull request by forking,
modifying and requesting a pull using the `hub` GitHub command line
tool or directly from the web. 

I'm not too picky about features and stuff, so if it's anything new,
be my guest. If it fixes an error, I
would be grateful if you first created an issue indicating the bug
you're about to fix. If it's a new feature, I'll gladly accept
it. This is not in a stage where I can, like, reject new features. But
as you might have seen, features are all tested so no new feature
accepted without the corresponding, passing, test. Test it in advance using `npm
test` or let Travis do the work for you. 

Anything not covered here? Raise an issue and I'll comply.

##Where to start

If you're looking for something to contribute, any fitness function
will be fine, we're always short of fitness functions to test. Check
[Ackley](/lib/Nodeo/Ackley.js) for an example.
