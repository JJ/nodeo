	<p>This webpage
	  includes the code
	  of <a href='http://github.com/JJ/nodeo'>NodEO</a>, a
	  JavaScript library for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm'>evolutionary
	  algorithms</a>. It starts running it when it loads. You can reload
	  to start it all over again. </p>
      
	<p>The evolutionary algorithm tries to find the 1s and 0s string that
	maximizes a certain function. In this case, maximum would correspond
	to a string filled with ones, only the algorithm does not know that
	in advance so it must try, change and combine mimicking natural
	selection until it finds the solution.</p>
