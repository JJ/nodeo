# NodEO

#### Evolutionary Algorithm, simplified, for node

NodEO includes the functions necessary to create a simple evolutionary algorithm in JavaScript in CommonJS format, for
node.js and anything else that uses that format. Can be converted to the browser using
Browserify, and works perfectly. Check out
[the presentation I did for FOSDEM](http://jj.github.io/js-ga-fosdem/#/home)
in case you want to know more about evolutionary algorithms and how
they have been implemented in JavaScript.
