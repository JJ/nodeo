## Evolutionary Algorithm, simplified, for node

NodEO includes the functions necessary to create a simple evolutionary algorithm in JavaScript in CommonJS format, for
node.js and anything else that uses that format. Can be (and indeed has been) converted to the browser using
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Check out
[the presentation I did for FOSDEM](http://jj.github.io/js-ga-fosdem/#/home)
in case you want to know more about evolutionary algorithms and how
they have been implemented in JavaScript.

## Build Status

## How to start

Hints on installing and running it.

### Installation

```bash
npm install nodeo
```

You can also clone it from this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JJ/nodeo.git
```

### Testing

If you have downloaded it from `npm`, it's already tested. If you have cloned it,

```bash
npm install 
npm test
```


### Running an evolutionary algorithm

There's a simple evolutionary algorithm in the `app` directory of this
repository. Run

	node app/ea.js

or

	node app/classic-ea.js

from the command line, for the version with a bit more complicated
data structures and no cached fitness function (lighter on the memory
front). 


## How to go further

You can try and add your own stuff to the library. Start here

### Contributing.

You will have to install a bit of more stuff, including Grunt, which,
for the time being, is used to check code and generate
documentation. That is

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And then

	grunt docco

to generate documentation (if you've installed docco previously) or

	grunt jshint

to check the code or

	grunt browsify

to generate a browser-ready evolutionary algorithm based on the
`classic` version.
