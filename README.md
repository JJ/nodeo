# nodeo

#### Evolutionary Algorithm, simplified, for node

Simple evolutionary algorithm in JavaScript in CommonJS format, for
node.js and anything else. Can be converted to the browser using
Browserify, and works perfectly. Check out
[the presentation I did for FOSDEM](http://jj.github.io/js-ga-fosdem/#/home)
in case you want to know more about evolutionary algorithms and how
they have been implemented in Javascript
